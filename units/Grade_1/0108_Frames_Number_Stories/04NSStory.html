            <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
            <p>Today we will practice using Animationa and Text to make our Story.</p>
            <h3>Making our Story</h3><hr>
            <p>Now that we have make our picture move, we are going to practice using our Frames Skills to turn our work into a story. Our story has a beginning. Now it needs two more parts - the middle and the end. Here are our example number stories from when we started. The middle part is the dark part:</p>
            <blockquote>James has 5 apples. <b>He gives 3 to Sally.</b> How many apples does James ahve left?</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Sejin has 12 pencils. <b>Bryan has 11 pencils.</b> How many pencils do Sejin and Bryan have together?</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Lena has 4 dollars. <b>She needs 7 dollars to buy the book she likes. </b>How many more dollars does Lena need so she can buy the book?</blockquote>
            <p>What are some ideas for the middle parts of your stories? When you make the middle, be sure to use the right number of objects from the library to show your story. When you are done with that, write the end part into a new slide. The end part is the question. So your steps for today:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Erase the text and write the second part of the number story in it's place.</li>
                <li>Use Copy and paste to make your picture show the second part of the number story.</li>
                <li>Erase the text again, and write the question part of the number story.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to write your name.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is an example of a finished Number Story in Frames.</p>
