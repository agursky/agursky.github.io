    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn how to group our pictures in iPhoto</p>
    <h3>Events</h3><hr>
    <p>In iPhoto, we can put our pictures together into different groups. These groups are called EVENTS. If I have a few pictures of Harry Potter, and a few Pictures of Animals, instead of having them all mixed together, I can have one EVENT called Harry Potter with all of my Harry Potter pics, and another EVENT called Animals with all of my animals pics. That way when I want to see a certain kind of picture, it is easy to find. I just click on that EVENT.</p>
    <img alt="slideshow pic" src="Pics/ip10.png" class="imgCenterLG">
    <p>To get different pictures together into one Event, just drag them on top of each other. This puts them all together into the same group. Then when you want to see only the pictures in that Event, you just click on that Event.</p>
