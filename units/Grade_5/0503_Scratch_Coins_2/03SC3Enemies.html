        <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
        <p>Today we will learn how to use Point Towards to make Enemies for our game.</p>
        <h3>Making an Enemy</h3><hr>      
        <p>The first thing we want to to do is make or Import a new Sprite to be an Enemy in the game. Once you have that done, we can make a new rule, and put into a FOREVER block attached to a Green Flag. Why again do we want to attach it to a Green Flag? </p>
        <p>When we use Move 10 steps we are telling a Sprite to Move Forward, which may be left or right depending on what direction it is facing. If we say move -10 we want it to move backward. How can we make a rule that our Enemy Sprite will chase us using the Following Blocks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forever Block</li>
            <li>Move 10 Steps - doesn't need to be 10 but some number</li>
            <li>The POINT TOWARD block in the Motion Menu</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, should we add a Wait Block? Why?</p>
        <p>Once you are done with that, make a new Variable to keep track of how many Lives the Cat Sprite has. When an Enemy touches it, the Cat Sprite should lose 1 life.</p>

        <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr> 
        <p>Make 1 or more new Sprites to be the enemy of your Cat Sprite. Use Code to make them chase your Sprite around, and to make the Cat Sprite lose 1 life every time it is caught.</p> 
        <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr> 
        <p>Make a special costume to show when the Cat Sprite gets caught by and Enemy.</p>
