        <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
        <p>Today we will make our game fun by making adjustments to our enemies, coins, and platforms.</p>
        <h3>Your Game is Too Easy - or Too Hard</h3><hr>
        <p>If it is too easy to win your game, or too hard, then your game is no fun. The point of this project is to learn programming, but some of the most important parts of the game have nothing to do with programming. It's about whether you enjoy playing your own game. Today you will spend time making small changes to your game that make it more challenging. To change your games difficulty change&#58;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The speed of the enemy</li>
            <li>Where the coins are</li>
            <li>Where the platforms are</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr> 
        <p>Change your game to make it more or less challenging. It should be hard to beat, but not impossible.</p> 
        <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr> 
        <p>For extra credit, add a new coin that gives your Sprite extra lives when it's caught.</p>
