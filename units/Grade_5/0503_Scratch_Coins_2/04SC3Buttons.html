        <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
        <p>Today we will learn how to make buttons for our Game.</p>
        <h3>Game Over</h3><hr>      
        <p>It is VERY EASY to make a Button in Scratch. You simply make a new Sprite and use code to turn it into a button. The code that we use is the WHEN CLICKED block from the Control menu.</p>
        <p>We will use this block to make a new button that says "Game Over - Play Again?" once the game is over.</p>
        <p> So far our game never ends, because there is no way for the player to lose. We should change that. Once the Sprite has 0 Lives we should show a new Sprite that says GAME OVER, and another new Sprite that says PLAY AGAIN. What code can we put together to do this?</p>

        <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr> 
        <p>Make a Start Game button that shows in the beginning of the game, and a Game Over Sprite that SHOWS when the Sprite has 0 lives left. Make a Play Again Button that starts a new game. Use the Broadcast block to make the Sprites start each game from the same place.</p> 
        <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr> 
        <p>Make another button that changes a setting or special effect in your game.</p>
