        <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
        <p>Today we will learn how to use Broadcast in Scratch.</p>
        <h3>Broadcast</h3><hr>
        <p>So far we have used Scratch by making Sprites, and having each Sprite have a set of codes that tells it what to do. Each of our Sprites can talk to itself, but none of the Sprites can talk to each other. We are going to change that today. We are going to make a Sprite that says Play Again, and we are going to turn it into a button. When we press it, it will tell OTHER Sprites to reset themselves to the beginning of the game.</p>
        <ul>Broadcast uses two or more Sprites
            <li>The First Sprite sends the message with a Broadcast block from teh Control Menu. We tell the Broadcast Block what message to say. It can be any message you want. It can even be 1 letter or number. The only thing that matters is that the other Sprites are looking for the same message.</li>
            <li>The other Sprites receive the Broadcast. We use the WHEN I RECIEVE block - also from teh Control Menu. We tell it to look for the matching message. Whatever codes we put under that will happen when the message is sent by the first Sprite.</li>
        </ul>
