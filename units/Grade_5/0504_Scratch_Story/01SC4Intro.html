    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
    <p>For our next project we are going to continue using Scratch, but we are going to start something new. We are going to use Scratch to create a story. This story will be interactive - that means that the user will control where the story goes, and what happens. We will use the skills that we have been learning this year so far to make this happen, and we will learn some new skills to make us better programmers.</p>
    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will create a sample Choose Your Own Adventure Story.</p>
    <h3>Interactive Stories</h3><hr>
    <p>Everyone loves stories. We are going to make an Interactive Story. An interactive story is a story where the person reading the story gets to make choices for the character. What happens to the character and will be different for every reader because each reader can make different choices. This kind of story is also fun to read more than once, because different choices lead to different endings.</p>
    <p>We are going to use Scratch to make an interactive story. The user will use buttons to tell the character what to do. Each student will get a chance to make up their own story. Today we are all going to make up a story as a group to show how this works.</p>
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>We will make up an interactive story as a group, and read it together.</p>
