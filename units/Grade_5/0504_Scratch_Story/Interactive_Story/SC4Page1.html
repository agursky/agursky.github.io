        <p>Once upon a time there was a little piece of pie. His name was Jerry. His favorite thing to do was eat cheese. It made him feel like a cheesecake. One day he was walking down the street dreaming of a nice big piece of cheese, when suddenly he saw a troll. The troll was big, and purple, and weird looking. He said "Hey pie bro, I need your help. I have a lot of cheese that I need to get over the bridge, and I'll give you some if you help me." </p>
        <p>The troll looked dangerous, but the cheese looked delicious. Jerry thought of what he should do.</p>
