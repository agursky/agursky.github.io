    <p>Intellectual Property means that when someone comes up with an idea, they own that idea. This doesn't only apply to ideas that are put into words, but it also means music, movies, and other forms of entertainment and information, that other people worked hard on.</p>
    <p>When we use other peoples ideas in our own work, it is important that we:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure we have permission to do so.</li>
        <li>Make sure we give them credit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Today we will look at two websites that help us do this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flickr Creative Commons - a websites of pictures posted by photographers who specifically give permission to others to use those pictures in other projects.</li>
        <li>Easybib.com - a website that helps us use the correct "Attribution Format". Attribution is when you say where and when you got the picture or words that you are using. Easybib makes it easy to say this in the correct way.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Download 5 images from flickr Creative Commons. Put them into the Microsoft Word Table on the left side. On the right side paste the attribution for that picture from easy bib - To get the Attribution from Easybib, copy the URL of the image from Flickr, and then paste it into the Attribution form in Easybib.</p>
