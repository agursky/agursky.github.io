    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn what Plagiarism is and how to make sure we don't do it.</p>
    <h3>What is Plagiarism?</h3><hr>
    <p>Plagiarism is when you use someone else's ideas and do not give them credit. An example of plagiarism is if a student was doing a project on a certain topic, found information on wikipedia, and then just copied and pasted the text from wikipedia into his or her assignment. When they handed that assignment in, the teacher would think that they wrote those words, when in fact, someone else did. This is dishonest.</p>

    <p>What could the student have done differently so that they were not being dishonest in their work?</p>
    <p>In order to be honest about our work it is important that we use sources the right way. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If we are using the exact words of someone else, we put those words in quotation marks so that the reader knows we are quoting another person. Then we say who the person was, and where we found the text so that we are giving credit to the person whose ideas we used.</li>
        <li>We can also rewrite information that we have found in our research into our own words. This doesn't mean changing one or two words. It means rewriting the entire thing in our own way, so that it fits into the project that we are putting it into.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Read the situations in the form below. Write if you think the person in them used information repsonsibly. If not, write what they could have done differently.</p>
