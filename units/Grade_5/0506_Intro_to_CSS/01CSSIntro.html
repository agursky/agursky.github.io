    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
    <p>For our next project we are going to learn about a new programming language called CSS. CSS is a very simple language that is used to change the way that an HTML Page looks. Colors, Sizes, and Layout (where things are on the page) are all set using CSS.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn what CSS looks like, and how to put it into our HTML Page.</p>
    <h3>Using Style tags for CSS</h3><hr>
    <p>There is more than one way to put CSS into a page. The way that we are going to do it, is by using style tags. Style tags are HTML tags. Unlike the HTML tags we have used so far, these tags go into the HEAD of the HTML page. Remember, we said that in an HTML Page, the body had all of the writing and pictures for the page, but the head had all of the information ABOUT the web page. The style information about the webpage goes in between the two HEAD tags. See the example below.</p>
    <p>All of our CSS goes in between the two style tags. The way to write CSS is to use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selector - the HTML tag you want to change</li>
        <li>Property - the thing about the HTML tag that you want to change</li>
        <li>Value - the thing you want to change it to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is an example that changes the color of the paragraph text to red, and changes its size to 14px. As you can see the way CSS works is pretty simple. You write:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The tag you want to change (like p or h1)</li>
        <li>Open Curly Brackets</li>
        <li>The thing you want to change about that tag.</li>
        <li>A colon (:)</li>
        <li>The thing you want to change it to.</li>
        <li>Close Curly Brackets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Web Colors</h3><hr>
    <p>To choose your own colors instead of just typing red, yellow, blue, etc. you need to know its web code. You can pick colors and get the web codes for it by clicking on the control-clicking on the color you picked, and then choosing "Quick Edit".</p>
    <p>There is also a great list of color names you can use .</p>

    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Start using CSS in your HTML Page. Use the <b>color</b> and <b>font-size</b> properties to change the text in the p tag. You can also change the background color of your webpage by using the <b>background-color</b> property with the html tag.</p>
