    <h3>Character Conversations</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we are going to learn about a new block called Broadcast. Broadcast is a very special block in scratch - it is a block that let's one Sprite tell other sprites what to do. Today we are going to use it to get our characters talking to each other to start the joke.</p>
    <p>We can use Broadcast to have the characters talk to each other. When one character is talking to another character two things should happen - they should SAY what they are saying, and they should BROADCAST it. When the other character gets that broadcast, they know it is there turn to talk.</p>

    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Have your 2nd sprite respond to the beginning of the joke with a Who, What, Where, When, or Why question - For example: if the first Sprite says "Why did the chicken cross the road?" The second Sprite says "I don't know. Why?" or if the first Sprite says "What does a cow eat for breakfast?" The second spirte should say "I don't know. What?"</p>
