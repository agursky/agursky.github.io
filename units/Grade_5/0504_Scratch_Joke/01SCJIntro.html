    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
    <p>For our next project we are going to continue using Scratch, but we are going to start something new. We are going to use Scratch to tell a joke. This will be a simple project that will be practice for a future project where we tell a whole story. We will use the skills that we have been learning this year so far to make this happen, and we will learn some new skills to make us better programmers.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will see how we can use Scratch to show characters having a conversation.</p>
    <h3>Using Scratch to Tell a Story</h3><hr>
    <p>Using Scratch for stories doesn not involve any new skill. It is actually easier than a lot of the stuff that we've been doing. We can tell the character what to do, how long to do it for, and what order to do it in. We put everything we want, in order, under the Green Flag.</p>

    <p>For our project, we are going to pick a simple joke, and use Scratch to have Sprites, tell the joke, as well as act it out. Here is a list of links to kids jokes if you need some ideas. Let's take some time, to look at jokes, and pick one that we want to use for our project.</p>
