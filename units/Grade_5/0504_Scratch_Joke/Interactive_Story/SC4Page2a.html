        <p>Jerry decided to help the troll. The troll said "Thanks pie bro. Just grab this end of the wagon, and I'll grab the other one, and we'll get this cheese across. Then something very strange happened. It started to rain doritos. The troll was very upset, but the pie was actually pretty excited about it.</p>
        <p>The troll said "I prefer purple doritos." I am going to do a magic spell that will make all the doritos purple." He started to do his spell, and the wind started to blow very hard. The bridge started to shake. All of the cheese started to fall off of the wagon. On the other side of the bridge, Jerry saw Mr. Cakey, his enemy, fall into the water. He didn't like Cakey, but he could see he was in danger. He didn't know whether to save the cheese or the guy.</p>
