        <p>Jerry decided he didn't like the looks of the troll, so he said "i'm sorry I'm very busy, and I cannot help you. Good luck!" Then he kept walking.</p>
        <p>He decided he was tired so he walked down by the water underneath the bridge. He was feeling very relaxed, and thought he might lay in the sun. He lay down and closed his eyes. He felt the warm sun on his face and was very happy. But then, he felt the sun disappear.</p>
        <p>When he opened his eyes, he saw that it was raining doritos. He could see the troll struggling on the bridge by himself. </p>
        <p>The cheese started to tumble off of the bridge, but it fell straight into the river. Jerry was scared. He ran under the bridge where he saw a different troll/. The troll said "My brother stole all of my cheese. Have you seen him he looks like except uglier?"</p>
        <p>A submarine comes out of the water and someone is in there. The troll said "I think you stole my cheese."</p>
