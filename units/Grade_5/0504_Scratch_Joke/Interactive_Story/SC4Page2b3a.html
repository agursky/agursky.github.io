        <p>Jerry decided to tell the troll about his brother. He felt that this second troll looked less weird looking than the one on the bridge, so he followed his instinct and told him that his brother had the cheese. As soon as he did, he saw all of the doritos turn purple. The brother troll said "I know you are telling the truth, because my brother alwasy makes doritos turn purple.</p>
        <p>The brother troll said "Listen I have a plan." The brother reached into his pack and pulled out a sword made out of cheese. He also pulled out a bow and arrow also made out of cheese. Choose your weapon" said the brother troll.</p>
