        <p>Jerry decided to choose the bow and arrow. The brother troll and Jerry used a rope to climb up the bridge. When the first troll saw Jerry and his brother He takes out a pocket knife made of cheese and says "I've always known this day would come brother. But I didn't think that you would be so cowardly as to align yourself with a pie for our final confrontation."</p>
        <p>It doesn't have to be this way we can both eat the cheese together."</p>
        <p>The first troll replied. "I would like that. But there is just one problem." I refuse to share our family cheese with a piece of cake who is so selfish and lazy that he refused to help me earlier. The two trolls turned on Jerry.</p>
        <p>Jerry says "Who do you think you are turning on your own friend. Then something unexpected happened. The first threw his knife expertly at jerrys head. But he forgot one thing. Jerry loved cheese. He opened his mouth and swallowed the knife. THank you he said. Do you have any more</p>
        <p>A loud sound came from above. It was the presidents helicpoter. He landed. The president sayse Excuse me but I believe that cheese belongs to me. The brother troll pulls his sword on the president, but Jerry who was very patriotic began to shoot bows and arrows at the trolls. Since the arrows were made of cheese they didn't kill the trolls but they were very annoying. The trolls were so distracted that the presidents bodygaurds had time to come in and arrest both trolls for cheese theft. He patted jerry on the back and said as a rewared for your patriotic service I will give all o fthis cheese to you. Have an ice day. Then he got back in his helicopter and flew away, leaving jerry with all types of cheese. the end. </p>
