            <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
            <p>Today we will learn how to add a column layout to our web page.</p>
            <h3>CSS Columns</h3><hr>
            <p>Sometimes we don't want everything to be stacked on vertically on our HTML Page. If we want two or more things next to each other, we have to write in special code to let the web page know to do that. To make this work, we have to use something called "Float". Float is a CSS rule that can be set to either left or right. It is called Float, because whatever is set to float sticks to the side of the page, and everything else on the page floats around it. Here is an example of a picture and a paragraph. The first example does not use float. The second does.</p>
            <p>To make columns of writing or writing and a picture that are next to each other we can use float and margin together. All we need to do is put what we want on the left into one div and what we want on the right into a different div. Then we can use classes to set rules for each div. Here is how we do this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the element on the left:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set the float to left.</li>
                    <li>Set the width to however wide you want it to be.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>For the element on the right:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set the margin-left to the same number or higher as the width of the element on the left. This will make the element on the right give the element on the left room.</li>
<!--                    <li>Set the width to take up the rest of the page.</li>-->
                </ul>
                <li>Both elements should use padding - othewise they will look like they are on top of each other.</li>
            </ul>
