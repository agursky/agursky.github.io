            <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
            <p>For our next project, we are going to continue learning CSS. We will learn how to add special rules for specific parts of the web page, as well as how to do animations and transitions on our buttons and other HTML Elements. Finally we will learn how to divide our page into colums so our writing and pictures can be side by side.</p>

            <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
            <p>Today we will learn how to use the classes in CSS.</p>
            <h3>CSS Classes</h3><hr>
            <p>So far we have learned to set rules for HTML Elements using CSS. We can set a rule for P TAGS that will change all of the paragraphs on the page. We can set a rule for IMG TAGS that will change all of the pictures on the page. CSS Classes are for when you don't want to change ALL of the things on your page of a certain type (like ALL images or ALL paragraphs). Classes can be used to change only a few of those things on your page, or only one if that's what you want.</p>
            <p>If my page has 4 paragraphs, and I want 3 of them to have green writing and 1 to have red writing, then that would be a good time to use a class. I would set a rule for P Tags in CSS to have green writing, but set a special rule for a CSS Class to have red writing, and write that the paragraph I want is part of that class. To do this: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a class name. It can be anything you want.</li>
                <li>In your HTML opening tag write class="className"</li>
                <li>In your CSS write the class name with a dot in front of it (like this: .classname) and then set your rules in your brackets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is an example.</p>
            <div class="imgCap">
                <img alt="pictures" src="Pics/css2_13.jpg" class="imgSet">
                Write the code like this in your CSS.
            </div>
            <div class="imgCap">
                <img alt="pictures" src="Pics/css2_4.jpg" class="imgSet">
                Write the code like this in your HTML.
            </div>
            
            <p>Don't forget the DOT:)</p>
