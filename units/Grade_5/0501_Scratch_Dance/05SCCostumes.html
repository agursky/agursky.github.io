    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn how to use Costumes to make the characters in our apps look like they are moving.</p>
    <h3>Changing Costumes</h3><hr>
    <p>In Scratch, Costumes means different ways that your character can look. This can mean that your character is wearing different clothes. But it can also mean that your character is just standing or sitting a different way. We can use Costumes to make our characters look more life like.</p>
    <p>If you double click on your character in the menu, you can see the costumes they have. You can even use the Edit button to change them, or add new ones. Once you have all of the costumes you want, you can find the codes to change them in the app in the Looks menu.</p>
