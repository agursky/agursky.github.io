    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn how to choose different Code Blocks and put them together in Scratch.</p>
    <h3>Scratch Menus</h3><hr>
    <p>In Scratch there are different menus for different kinds of codes that we can use. What are some of the menu's you see? We can use any of these codes to give the computer instructions. In Scratch each part of our app has it's own instructions. So if we have a game with a cat and a mouse, there will be once set of codes for the cat, and one set of codes for the mouse. When we find a code we want, we just drag it into the workspace.</p>
    <p> Sometimes codes work together. When we want codes to work together we attach them. The code on top goes first and the code on the bottom goes next. We can attach as many codes as we want. When we want to see the codes work, we can click on them.</p>

    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we are going to put codes together to make the cat dance. We are going to use codes that make the cat move, and codes that make sounds.</p>
    <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr>
    <p>Change the number of steps and the sounds that the cat dances to. Add more moves to the dance if you want. Have fun with it:)</p>
