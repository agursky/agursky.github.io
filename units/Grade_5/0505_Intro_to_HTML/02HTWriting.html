        <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
        <p>Today we will learn how to write text in HTML.</p>
            
        <h3>Writing onto Webpages.</h3><hr>
        <p>Working with HTML is very easy. All that you need to put something on your page is to find out what the tag for that thing is. There are two types of tags that we use to write text in HTML - Title tags and Paragraph tags.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paragraph tags are used to write regular text. Write what you want in between two "p" tags, like in the example below.</li>
                <li>Title tags are for different titles. There are six different title tags. They all work the same, they are just different sizes. The tags are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. h1 is the biggest. h6 is the smallest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the example below we can see how HTML writing turns into a webpage when it is in the browser.</p>

        <img alt="html template" src="Pics/ht4.jpg">
        <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
        <p>Use at least one title tag, and at least one paragraph tag to write onto a webpage. It doesn't matter what you write. Today is about practice, so feel free to write something silly if you want.</p>
            <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr>
            <p>When you are done, feel free to experiment with the other title tags and with more p tags to add writing to your page.</p>
