        <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
        <p>Today we will learn how to write Comments in HTML.</p>
            
        <h3>Using Comments in HTML</h3><hr>
        <p>A big webpage can have a lot of code on it, and if we or someone else wants to look at it, it can be very confusing. That is why we use comments. Comments can be helpful to us when we are going over our HTML code and trying to see where something is, or remember why we wrote it. Unlike tags, when we write comments into our HTML, the web browser ignores it. To add a comment to your code just write a less than sign, an exclamation point, and two dashes. Anything you write after that is your comment. To end your comments write 2 more dashes and a greater than sign. See the example below. </p>

        <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
        <p>Pick a topic that you like writing about, and put together a simple web page about that topic. Write the title using h tags, write a paragraph using p tags, and include as many pictures as you want. Use comments after each of your tags to show that you know what those tags do. For example:</p>
