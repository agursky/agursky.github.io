        <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
        <p>Today we will learn how to add pictures to our webpage.</p>
            
        <h3>Adding Pictures to our Webpage</h3><hr>
        <p>As we learned before, to add something to our webpage we just need to find out what the tag is. For pictures the tag is img. But picture tags work differently than regular tags in two important ways.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is NO closing tag.</li>
                <li>The img tag has special properties called ATTRIBUTES that tell about the img tag. We need to tell it where to get the image from.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do we Write Attributes?</h3><hr>
            <p>Attributes go after the tag, but BEFORE the greater than sign. You write:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The attribute name</li>
                <li>and equals sign</li>
                <li>The attribute value in quotation marks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So if I had a picture on my desktop named happy.jpg, I would add it as an attribute inside the img tag, this:</p>
        <img alt="html template" src="Pics/ht21.jpg">
            <p>You also need to tell the webpage if the picture is in a folder. If I had a picture called happy.jpg in a folder called Pics, the tag would look like this:</p>
            <img alt="html template" src="Pics/ht22.jpg">
        <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
        <p>Practice using the img tag by adding the happy picture, which should be on your desktop, into your HTML page.</p>
            <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr>
            <p>When you are done, feel free to get other pictures from the internet, drag them onto your desktop, and add them to your web page.</p>
