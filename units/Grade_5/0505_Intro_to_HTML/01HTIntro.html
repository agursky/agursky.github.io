        <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
        <p>For our next project we will be learning how to write HTML. HTML is a coding language that is used to make websites. Every webpage that you go to uses HTML to make writing, pictures, videos, and anything else that goes on the page. The page that you are reading right now was made using HTML. We will be using a free app called Brackets to write our code. We will write HTML code, and see our webpages using web browsers like Safari, Google Chrome, or Firefox.</p>

        <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
        <p>Today we will learn what HTML looks like.</p>
        <h3>HTML Tags</h3><hr>
        <p>The way that HTML works is simple. The web browser (like Safari, Chrome, etc) reads HTML codes called tags to know what you want your website to say. If I wanted to write a paragraph, I would write whatever I wanted in between two paragraph tags. If I wanted to write a title, I would write the title in between two title tags. An HTML tag is a letter or letters in between a less than sign (&#60;) and a greater than sign ( &#62;). Here is an example of a pair of paragraph tags: &#60;p&#62;I write my paragraph here.&#60;/p&#62;. Notice how the ending paragraph tag has a forward slash before the p. Almost all HTML tags work like this - an opening tag, and a closing tag which is exactly the same as the opening tag, except that it has a forward slash in the beginning.</p>
        <h3>Setting up our Page</h3><hr>
        <p>Before we start writing and adding pictures, we need to set up our web page. This is done by putting together a few HTML tags that help the page work the right way. They are an html tag - &#60;html&#62;</p>, a head tag - &#60;head&#62;, and a body tag - &#60;p&#62;. There is also a DOCTYPE tag in the beginning. You don't need to know what all of these mean yet, but it is good practice writing pairs of tags to get you started. So set up your webpage by copying these tags exactly in this order:</p>
        <img alt="html template" src="Pics/template.png">
        <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
        <p>Set up your webpage by typing in your setup tags to a new file in Brackets. Save your file on your DESKTOP. Name it Your First Name.html with no spaces.</p>
