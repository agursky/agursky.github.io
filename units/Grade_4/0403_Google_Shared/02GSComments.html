    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
    <p>Today we will learn how to leave comments on our Shared Documents.We will also choose which Explorer to focus on.</p>
    <h3>Explorer Choices</h3><hr> 
    <p>Today each member of the group will choose one New York Explorer to research. Each member will be responsible for writing about their Explorer on the Shared Document. When you are finished you will have a paper that has information about these European Explorers that anyone can use to learn. Your choices are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Henry Hudson</li>
        <li>Samuel Di Champlain</li>
        <li>Giovanni Da Verrazzano</li>
        <li>Christopher Columbus - Columbus didn't really explore New York, but his discoveries led other explorers to try to come here, so he is important to New York.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Comments on Google Docs</h3><hr> 
    <p>When we are working together on a Shared Document, sometimes we want to say something to the people we are working with. But if we aren't sitting next to them that might be hard. We can use comments to talk to each other while we are working. Leave comments on your document to tell the other group members which of the 4 topics you would like to be responsible for.We can leave a comment by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pressing the gray comments button in the top right corner.</li>
        <li>Clicking Comments from the choices.</li>
        <li>Writing your comment in the box.</li>
        <li>Press the blue button to save it.</li>
    </ol>
