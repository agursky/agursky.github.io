    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
    <p>Today we will begin researching our Explorer.</p>
    <h3>What to Research</h3><hr> 
    <p>Each member of the group should type 2 paragraphs about their explorer. They should use the research sites to find information that they can use in their Shared Document. Your research should focus on Who, What, When, Where, Why. Some important information to look for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who was your explorer?</li>
        <li>Where were they from?</li>
        <li>When did they sail to New York?</li>
        <li>What part of New York and the area around it did they explore?</li>
        <li>How did they explore - what tools did they use?</li>
        <li>Why did they become an explorer?</li>
        <li>Who gave them the money to sail - which King or Queen?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Those aren't the only questions you can ask, but it's a good way to get started. </p>
    <p>You should be writing in Paragraph form, you are not making a list, and remember to follow all Rules of Typing on the Computer. You may want to start by making a list of important facts, and then organize it later.</p>
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
