    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn what Google Docs is, and how it is different from Microsoft Office.</p>
    <h3>Intro to Google Docs</h3><hr>
    <p>Google Docs is part of Google Drive. Most Cloud Computing websites like Google Drive let you save your files in them, but what makes Google Drive special is that it lets you make files in it too. That is what Google Docs is. It is used for making different kinds of writing files. It's a lot like Microsoft Office, which we have already used a lot.</p>
    <ul>In Microsoft Office we use:
        <li>Microsoft Word to write on a page</li>
        <li>Microsoft Excel to make Spreadsheets</li>
        <li>Miscrosoft Powerpoint to make Slideshows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can use Google Docs to make Writing Files, Spreadsheets, and Slideshows too. But when we do it on Google Docs it is saved in the Cloud, which means that if I start working on it on one computer, I can finish working on it later on another computer. Here are some other ways they are different.</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Google Docs saves what you write everytime you write a letter</td>
            <td>You have to save your work. If you forget, you lose whatever your wrote.</td>
