    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
    <p>For our next project we are going to be going back to Google Docs to learn to make something new - Google Forms. Google Forms is a fun way to make a survey that your friends can take online. We have already taken Google Forms surveys in some of our lessons. Now we will be making some of our own. We will post our surveys online for our friends to take, and we will use Google Docs to look at the results.</p>
