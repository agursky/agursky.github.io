    <h3>Teaching Point</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn how to edit the different pages on our on Google Sites.</p>
    <h3>Editing Pages in Google Sites</h3><hr>
    <p>Editing means "changing". To change, or Edit the pages on our Google Sites, we go to that page and we click on the "Pencil" Button on the top. Once we do this, we see a box open up that lets us make changes to the "Content" or inside of our webpage.</p>
    <ul>Changes we can make:
        <li>To type we just type.</li>
        <li>To add a picture we go to "Insert-Image" at the top. We can Insert other things too. You can look at the menu to see what they are.</li>
        <li>Layout changes the way that our page is set up. We can have everything fit into one column, just like a Google Doc or Microsoft Word Document, or we can use more than one column. If we want to have our words next to a picture instead of on top of it, we would use layout to change this.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Begin adding content to your pages. For writing you should have 2 paragraphs about the pages topic. You should also add at least one picture. Please make sure you are writing about what the page is supposed to be about, and not something random:&#41;</p>
    <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr>
    <p>Make an extra page that uses the "List" Template. You can use it to show links to other good websites about your topic.</p>
