    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn how to use the Wait block to make Animations.</p>

    <p>Then we just make the sprite switch to the next costume over and over again until it makes it to the last costume. Don't forget to put a wait block in the code so that it doesn't go too fast.</p>
