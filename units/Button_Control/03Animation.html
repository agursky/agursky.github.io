    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn how to use the Wait block to make Animations.</p>
    <h3>Animation in Scratch</h3><hr>
    <p>We can use costumes to make our character look like it is moving. The key to a good animation is that the two costumes are almost exactly the same with just one small difference. If we put a WAIT block in between the two costumes, we can control how fast the character moves.</p>
