    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr> 
    <p>We are going to be learning about Internet Safety to help us know the right and wrong things to do not only on the blogs, but on websites we visit at home.

    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>

    <h3>What is Netiquette?</h3><hr> 
    <p>Now that we are using blogs, it is important that we practice good Netiquette. Netiquette is how we act when we are online. Remember, what we do on the blogs, and on any internet site such as Youtube, Facebook, or Twitter is public. That means anyone can see it. If we leave a comment on someones blog page, not only can that person see it, but so can everyone else. </p>
    <p> When we are not nice online, not only do we embarass the person we are talking to in front of  A LOT of people, but we also embarass ourselves, because people see a mean comment and thing "that person isn't someone I want to be friends with".</p>
    <p>When we are on the computer or out in the world, we should always treat people the way that we want to be treated. </p>
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
