    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will review what makes an Community and Urban Community.</p>
    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
    <p>For this project we are going to be using Kid Pix to make Stamp Posters. Last year we used the Stamp Tool to make posters of different types of Animals. This year we will be doing something that's almost the same. We will be using the Stamps to make posters of different types of Communities. There are 3 different types of Communities - Urban, Suburban, and Rural. We are going to learn what makes each of those communities special.</p>
    <h3>Urban Communities</h3><hr>
    <p>The biggest kind of Community is called an Urban Community. What makes an Urban Community special is that it has many, many people in it. Urban Communities have a lot of stuff in them that is made to fit many people. Big buildings, big parks, stadiums, zoos, and more. They also have to have things in them to help people get around - like subways, buses, and highways for all of the cars. Our city is an Urban Community. What are some of the other things that we see in Urban Communities like our city?</p>
