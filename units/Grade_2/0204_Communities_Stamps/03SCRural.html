    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will review what makes an Community and Rural Community.</p>
    <h3>Rural Communities</h3><hr>
    <p>Rural Communities are special because they are the least crowded communities. Very few people live there, so there is a lot of open space. A lot of the space in Rural Communities is used for farming. The food that we buy in the supermarket in Urban and Suburban Communities is usually grown in Rural Communities and driven here in trucks. There is not a lot of traffic in Rural Communities, because there are not a lot of people. Can we think of other things in Rural Communities that make them special?</p>
