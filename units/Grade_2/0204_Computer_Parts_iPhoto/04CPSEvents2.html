    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn how move pictures from one Event to another.</p>
    <h3>Switching Events</h3><hr>
    <p>As we learned yesterday, a group of pictures in iPhoto is called an EVENT. It is easy to put a picture into an Event from the main window, but sometimes a picture is already in an EVENT, so we don't see it in the main window. If we want to move that picture from one EVENT to another, we have to be able to see it. To do that we look at the PHOTOS Window.</p>
    <p>The Photos Window has all of the same pictures as the Events Window, but it lets us see all of our pictures, even the ones that are part of Events. If we want to move a picture from one Event to another, we can just drag it. Watch the video below to see how.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Manela - play the video. Thank you:)</p>
