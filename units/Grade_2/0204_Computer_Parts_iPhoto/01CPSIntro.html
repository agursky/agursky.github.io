    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
    <p>For our Next Project we are going to start using a new program called iPhoto. iPhoto is used to collect and look at pictures. It is a good way to keep a lot of pictures in order, so that when you want to see one picture, it is easy to find it. We will be getting pictures from picasa about the different parts of a computer. When we are done we will bring them into iPhoto, and use iPhoto to make them into a slideshow.</p>
    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will review the different parts of a computer.</p>
    <h3>Computer Parts</h3><hr>
        <div class="imgCap"><img alt="computer part picture" class="imgSet" src="Pics/cp1.jpg">Speakers</div>
    <div class="imgCap"><img alt="computer part picture" class="imgSet" src="Pics/cp2.jpg">Computer Tower</div>
    <div class="imgCap"><img alt="computer part picture" class="imgSet" src="Pics/cp4.jpg">Mouse</div>
    <div class="imgCap"><img alt="computer part picture" class="imgSet" src="Pics/cp3.jpg">Monitor</div>
    <div class="imgCap"><img alt="computer part picture" class="imgSet" src="Pics/cp5.jpg">USB Drive</div>
    <div class="imgCap"><img alt="computer part picture" class="imgSet" src="Pics/cp6.jpg">Keyboard</div>
    <p>The computer is made up of many different parts, and each part has a special job. If one part doesn't work, than it is very hard to use the computer to do anything. If the mouse is missing or broken, or the keyboard doesn't work, you can't tell the computer what to do. If the screen is broken, you can see what you are doing. Let's review the different parts of the computer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Mouse - the mouse helps us click on buttons on our screen.</li>
        <li>The Keyboard - the keyboard helps us type letters.</li>
        <li>The Monitor - the monitor is the screen of our computer. It helps us see what we are doing.</li>
        <li>The Hard Drive - the Hard Drive is the inside part of the computer. It's like the computers brain. It saves our files, and helps the computer work the right way.</li>
        <li>The computer also has extra parts that help us. Not every computer has these parts. Some extra parts are&#58;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Speakers - for playing sounds and music</li>
            <li>The Printer to help us print paper copies of information.</li>
            <li>The Disc Drive to read information from outside of the computer, or write it to the outside of the computer. Discs can be CD's, DVD's, or Thumb Drives.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>So a computer needs a lot of parts to work the right way. Today we are going to get pictures of different computer parts for our slideshow.</p>
