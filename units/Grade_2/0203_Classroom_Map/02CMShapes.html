            <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
            <p>Today we will learn how to use the Shapes Tool in Kid Pix.</p>
            <h3>The Shapes Tool</h3><hr> 
            <p>As we have seen many things that we see in Bird's Eye View look like simple shapes. A schoolbus in Bird's Eye View just looks like a yellow recatangle. A building looks like a square or rectangle too, because all that we can see is the roof. For our project, we are going to be using the Shapes Tool to help us make our maps.</p>
            <p>You can choose to make a map of the computer lab, your classroom downstairs, or any room in your home. Remember that this map should be in birds eye view. So if you were making a computer desk, it would look like a gray rectangle, and the computers on the desk would look like littel rectangles.</p>
        <p>To make Shapes in Kid Pix:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Press the Pink Pencil Tools</li>
            <li>Choose your shape from the choices on the bottom.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>TIP: Remember - a quick way to change the colors of things after you draw them is to use the Paint Bucket Tool.</p>

            <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr> 
            <p>Start your map. Try to make as many things in the room as you can remember. Don't forget to only use the Shapes Tool to do this. Save your file on your DESKTOP and name in Your Name &#43; MAP.</p>
