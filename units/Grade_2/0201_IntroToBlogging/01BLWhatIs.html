    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will learn what a Blog is, and what it is used for.</p>
    <h3>What is a Blog?</h3><hr>
    <p>A blog is a webpage that is like a journal or diary. You can put videos, pictures, and words on your blog. Whenever you add something new to your blog, it is called a "Blog Entry". A person can make a blog about anything - sports, movies, funny stories...anything they like to write about.</p>
        <p>Other people can see a persons blog when they go to their web address. They can even leave comments on Blog Entries they like.</p>
    <p>This year, each student will get there own blog. You will use it to show the work you do in computer class. You can also choose to post other stuff on it that isn't about school if you want. Other students in the school will be able to see your blog, and leave comments on what you post.</p>
    <p>This blog will be yours to add to all the way until you graduate in 5th grade.</p>
