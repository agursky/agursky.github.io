    <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we are going to ask our classmates to take our Surveys in Microsoft Excel.</p>
    <img alt="excel project picture" class="imgCenterMED" src="Pics/es2.jpg">
    <h3>Survey Results</h3><hr>
    <p>Remember, a survey gives you information about what people think and puts it together in a neat, easy to read list. That is why Excel is such a good tool to use to make them. Today we will take turns getting up and taking each others surveys. When people are taking your survey, you should which choice they made in the cell next to that choice. So if I pick dog as my favorite pet, and dog is written in cell A3, write that I chose it in the next cell over - B3. Here are the rules for our class surveys:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only get up when it is your turn.</li>
        <li>Take EVERYONE'S survey. Take the surveys in order - start at the first chair near the door and go one person at a time until you get to the end of ther room.</li>
        <li>If you get to a persons seat and they are not there because they are up taking someone else's survey, you skip them and do not go back to them later.</li>
        <li>Try to move quickly so that everyone gets a turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Record peoples answers to your survey question in the B Column of your Spreadsheet.</p>
