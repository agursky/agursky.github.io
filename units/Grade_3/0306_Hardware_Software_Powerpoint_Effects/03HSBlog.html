            <h3>Teaching Point:</h3><hr> 
            <p>Today we will learn review Exporting, and putting our work on our Blog.</p>
            <h3>Why Do We Export&#63;</h3><hr> 
            <p>When we are done with our work, we want to Export it and put it on our blog. The reason we Export is because a Powerpoint file will not go on our Blog. Our Blogs only know how to have web files. So Exporting makes a copy of your work for the web. Once you have that web file, you are able to put it on your blog. When you export name your work whatever the name was, with an X at the end of it. To Export in Powerpoint: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to FILE</li>
                <li>Click SAVE AS MOVIE</li>
                <li>Make sure to save it on your DESKTOP</li>
                <li>You can add an X to the end of it's name, so that you can tell it apart from your non export powerpoint file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use the Videos below to help you export and put your work on the blog.</p>
