    <h3>Adding Pictures to your Slides</h3><hr>
    <p>Slideshows are more fun to watch when they have pictures. If we want to add a picture to our slides, we have to make room for it first. Right now there isn't a lot of room on the slide. To change that, we have to change the Layout. Layout where things are.</p>
    <p>Here's how you change the Layout of a slide.</p>
    <p>Once you have done that you can drag the picture you want onto the slide. For this project, we are going to be getting pictures from Picasa. Picasa is a web page that you can use to share your pictures with other people. Here's how you use Picasa to get a picture. Once you have the picture you want you can drag it onto the Desktop, and then from the Desktop to you slide. </p>
