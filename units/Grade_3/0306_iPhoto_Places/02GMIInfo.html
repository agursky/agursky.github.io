    <h3>Photo Info</h3><hr>
    <p>iPhoto is not only good for working with large groups of pictures. It can also be used to change or add to one picture. We can add information about a picture using the info button. Each picture has it's own set of information, such as when it was taken, where it was taken, who was in it, and what it's name is. To add information to your picture&#58;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the picture you want to change.</li>
        <li>Click Info on the bottom right. This will open up an info window.</li>
