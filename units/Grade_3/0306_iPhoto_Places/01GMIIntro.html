    <h3>Project Intro</h3><hr>
    <p>Now that we have learned how to use Google Maps, and gotten pictures from it, we are going to put those pictures together into a Slideshow in iPhoto. This slideshow will have a map of the whole world, and it will show where each of those pictures came from.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Point&#58;</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we will review the basics of iPhoto and import our Google Maps pictures.</p>
    <h3>Events</h3><hr>
    <p>In iPhoto, we can put our pictures together into different groups. These groups are called EVENTS. Events are an easy way to keep our pictures organized. If we have a lot of pictures and they're all just sitting in iPhoto randomly, it would be really hard to find a picture that we are looking for. Putting the pictures into groups that make sense helps us. </p>
    <p>To get different pictures together into one Event, just drag them on top of each other. This puts them all together into the same group. Then when you want to see only the pictures in that Event, you just click on that Event.</p>

    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Take the pictures you got from Google Maps and put them into different Events showing which country they came from. Each country should have its own Event.</p>
