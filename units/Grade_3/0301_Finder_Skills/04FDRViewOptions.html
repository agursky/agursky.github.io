        <h3>Teaching Point</h3><hr>
        <p>Today we will learn how to use View Options to make our Desktop look like we want it to.</p>
        <h3>View Options</h3><hr>
        <p>We can use View Options in Finder to make our Desktop and our Folders look and act the way that we want them to. Options is another way to say "choices", so View Options has all of your View Choices in it. To change the way your Desktop looks, click on the Desktop and then go to "View-Show View Options" on top. You can also use "Command-J".</p>
        <p>The View Options are different when you are inside a folder. These View Options let you decide what order you want your Files to be listed in.</p>
