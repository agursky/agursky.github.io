        <h3>Teaching Point</h3><hr>
        <p>Today we will learn how to use the Finder to see what's on our computer.</p>
        <h3>What is Finder?</h3><hr>
        <p>We Have been using Files for a while on the computer. We have made files, and saved them. We have also downloaded files, like Pictures from Wikipedia, and saved them to our Desktop. All of the Files on the computer are saved on the "Finder". The Finder has many different folders full of files we use, apps that we use, and other files that we never see, but the computer uses to help it work the right way for us. We mostly save our work onto our Desktop, because that is the easiest place to find our work. But there are other folders that we can see when we open up a "Finder Window". We do this by clicking on the Finder on the dock.</p>
        <h3>Switching Between Views</h3><hr>
        <p>There are 4 ways to see what is in a Folder on the computer:</p>
        <img class = "imgCenterMED" src="Pics/Icon.png"><div>Icon View - good for seeing pictures of your files.</div>
        <img class = "imgCenterMED" src="Pics/List.png"><div>List View - good for seeing information about your files like when you made it.</div>
        <img class = "imgCenterMED" src="Pics/Column.png"><div>Column View - good for going back and forth between many folders.</div>
        <img class = "imgCenterMED" src="Pics/cover.png"><div>Cover View - Like List View, but it looks cool.</div>
