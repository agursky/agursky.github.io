    <h3>Powerpoint Link Buttons</h3><hr>
    <p>In powerpoint, we have made slideshows where the person watching sees the first slide first, then the second slide, then the third, then the fourth, and so on. But it doesn't need to work that way. Another way to do it is to make buttons, or "Links" in the slideshow. A person watching the show can choose which slide they want to go to, and press the button for that slide.</p>
    <p>For our Slideshow we are going to use these kinds of buttons. We will make a slide that is a "Table of Contents" listing every slide we have. Then we will turn each slide in the list into a button that will go to that slide. If someone wants to learn about Keyboards, they will look at the Table on Contents and click "Click Here to Learn about Keyboards". If a person wants to learn about Kid Pix, they will go to the Table of Contents and click "Click Here to Learn about Frames".</p>
    <div class="imgCap"><img alt="project picture" class="imgSet imgCenterLG" src="Pics/HSPics3.png">Here is an example of a Table of Contents for a Slideshow about Plant Parts</div>
    <p>Once you type all of the buttons into your Table of Contents, you can use the video below to make the buttons work.</p>

    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
