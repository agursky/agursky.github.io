    <h3>Teaching Point</h3><hr>
    <p>Students will create the outline for the slides in their Hardware Software Slideshow</p>
    <h3>Examples of Hardware and Software</h3><hr>
    <p>The rest of your slideshow will be examples of Hardware and Software. You can start by picking one example of Hardware you can think of, and making a new slide to talk about it. Add one new slide. The title should be the piece of Hardware you want to talk about. In the Text Box, write three sentences about that Hardware. You can say what it does, what it looks like, how it helps us, or anything else that comes to mind.</p>
    <p>When you are done you should make two more Hardware Example Slides, and then 3 Software Example Slides. Remember, each slide only talks about ONE example of Hardware or Software.</p>
    <p>When you are finished with all of your slides your slideshow should have a total of 8 slides: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slide 1: Title Slide</li>
        <li>Slide 2: Introduction</li>
        <li>Slide 3: 1st Hardware Example</li>
        <li>Slide 4: 2nd Hardware Example</li>
        <li>Slide 5: 3rd Hardware Example</li>
        <li>Slide 6: 1st Software Example</li>
        <li>Slide 7: 2nd Software Example</li>
        <li>Slide 8: 3rd Software Example</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Today's Assignment</h3><hr>
    <p>Create the rest of your slides, but don't write in them. Only write the titles. Use the list above as a guide. </p>
