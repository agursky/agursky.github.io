    <h3>Using Google Maps to find Landmarks</h3><hr>
    <p>Landmarks are famous places. There are famous places all over the world. New York City has many famous places, including the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Freedom Tower. Not all famous places were made by people. Some of them come from Nature, like the Grand Canyon. What makes a place special enough to be famous?</p>

        <p>We are going to use Google Maps today to find Famous Places. You may not know the famous places in your country yet, so if you don't you can use Time For Kids to find a few. When you find a famous place you'd like to look at, go to Google Maps in a new window, and type the place in. You should use the name of the place, a comma, and then the country, like this:
</p>
        <li>Grand Canyon, USA</li>
        <li>Eiffel Tower, France</li>
        <p>Remember - it won't work unless you spell it the right way.</p>
    <h3>Today's Task</h3><hr>
    <p>Choose at least 2 of the Landmarks in the list below, and take Screenshots of them using Google Streetview. Rename them "Landmark 1" and "Landmark 2" and put them into your folders.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sagrada Familia, Spain</li>
            <li>Palacio Real, Spain</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
