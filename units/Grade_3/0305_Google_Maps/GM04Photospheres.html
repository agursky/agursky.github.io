    <h3>Google Maps Photospheres</h3><hr>
    <p>Google Maps Photospheres is a new part of Google Maps. It's like streetview, but with two main differences: </p>
        <li>Instead of pictures taken by the Google Street View Car, they are pictures taken by regular people like you and me, and shared onto the Google Maps Site for others to see. </li>
        <li>It is also different, because it shows a 360 Degree View - meaning you can see what a spot looks when you look in any direction.</li><br>

    <p>This is an example of how some of the best things on the internet, are not made by one person or company, but are made by many people all over the world working together to contribute. Wikipedia works the same way. No one person wrote wikipedia. Everyone who wanted to shared their knowledge to create that site. Any one of you could contribute to Google Views (or Wikipedia).</p>
    <h3>Today's Task</h3><hr>
    <p>You will use Google Photospheres to see what your country looks like on the ground. 
        <li>Please take a screenshot of 2 Photosphers in your country. </li>
        <li>Rename them: "PS1" and "PS2" (because Photosphere is hard to spell).</li>
        <li>Add them to your Screenshots Folder.</li><br><br>
