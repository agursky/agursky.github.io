    <h3>Project Wrap Up</h3><hr>
    <p>Today we are going to review what we have done, and make sure that we have all of our screenshots.</p>
    <h3>Summary</h3><hr>
    <p>You should each have a folder on your Desktop named "Google Maps Screenshot Folder". This folder should have the following things in it:</p>
    <li>3 Screenshots of your country from Satellite View, named Screenshot 1, Screenshot 2, and Screenshot 3</li>
        <li>3 Screenshots of your country from Street View, named Street View 1, Street View 2, and Street View 3</li>
        <li>2 Screenshots of your country from "Photospheres", named PS1, PS2</li>
        <li>2 Screenshots of your country from "Directions", named Directions 1, Directions 2</li>
        <h3>Today's Task</h3><hr>
        <p>Please take a screenshot of your Folder and post it to your blog. If you are missing Map screeshots, or your Map screenshots are not named correctly, fix this first, then post to your blog.</p>
        <h3>Extension Activity</h3><hr>
        <p>Go back through the other instructions, and fill out any of the forms you didn't get a chance to finish. Once you are done with that you can choose from one of the Extension Activities on the other pages. </p>
